# Common concurrency problem
- We know deadlock by now

## Non-Deadlock bugs 
- Atomicity violation
    ```C
    //Thread 1::
    if (thd->proc_info) {
        fputs(thd->proc_info, ...);
    }
    //Thread 2::
    thd->proc_info = NULL;
    ```
    - first thread check non-null and print, second thread set null
    - bug happen when first thread didnt get to call put, second thread interrupt and set flag to null
    - The desired serializability among multiple memory accesses
    is violated (i.e. a code region is intended to be atomic, but the atomicity
    is not enforced during execution).”
    - simply adding lock around these 2 crit section will resolve this bug
- order violation
    ```C
    //Thread 1::
    void init() {
        mThread = PR_CreateThread(mMain, ...);
    }   
    //Thread 2::
    void mMain(...) {
        mState = mThread->State;
    }
    ```
    - thread 2 assume the thread is already init so if thread 2 run first we are fucked
    - “The desired order between two (groups of) memory accesses is flipped (i.e., A
        should always be executed before B, but the order is not enforced during
        execution)”
    - use CV to enfore ordering

## DeadLocks
- Happen when thread1 is holding lock and waiting for another to be done, but other thread is waiting for thread1 to release the lock
- Reasons this happen:
    - dependency in huge code base usually cause this to happen (cicular dependency)
    - Encapsulation from modular design
- **Condition for Deadlock to happen**
    - Mutex: exlusive resources others required
    - Hold-and-wait: Threads hold resources allocated to them (e.g., locks that they have already acquired) while waiting for additional    resources (e.g., locks that they wish to acquire)
    - No preemption: resources can't be removed by force from threads
    - Circular wait: chains of threads they are waiting for resources being waited by other threads
- when all 4 meets, deadlock happens

## Prevent Deadlock
- Circular wait:
    - provide our own total ordering in lock getter
    - we can also use like partial ordering like memory mapping code in linux
- Hold and Wait:
    - lock preventation allow the untimely switch wont happen between mid lock acquisition
    - encapsulation is our enemy: when calling a routine, this approach requires us to know exactly which locks must be held and to acquire them ahead of time, result in decrease concurrency
- No Preemption:
    - a lot of time we are waiting for lock while holding one
    - we can use try lock to tell us the state of the lock and unlock if needed
    - watchout for livelock (2 threads keep trying to trylock and unlock)
- Mutex:
    - hardware instruction can help?
    ```C
    int CompareAndSwap(int *address, int expected, int new) {
        if (*address == expected) {
            *address = new;
            return 1; // success
        }
        return 0; // failure
    }
    ```
- deadlock avoidance scheduling:
    - Avoidance requires some global knowledge of which locks
    various threads might grab during their execution, and subsequently schedules said threads in a way as to guarantee no deadlock can occur.
- detect and recover:
    - is just a stupid recover cycle based on when the deadlock will happen
