# The Processes 
- informally, it is just a running program
- we don't need to worry about CPU's availiability because we virtualize cpu
    - run one process, stop and run another, repeat 
- *time sharing*
    - potential slow performance but run it concurrently with as mand processes as possible
    - all modern OS has this 

- *sapece sharing 
    - something like disc
### Mechanism (the How)
- low level machinery, basically low level mehtods or protocol implement piece of functionality. 
- *context switch* OS asked to stop a program and run another

### Policies (the Which)
- Policies are algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS
- schedule policy will decide which progam OS should run
- likely using historical information (e.g., which program has run more over the last minute?),
- workload knowledge (e.g., what types of programs are run), and performance metrics (e.g., is the system optimizing for interactive performance,
or throughput?) to make its decision.


## The abstract: A process
- The abstraction provided by the OS of a running program is something we will call a process.
- **machine state: what can program write or read when its running**
    - memory process can address (address space) if part of the process
    - register, instructions are read and update through it
        - Program Counter (PC) or called Instruction Pointer (IP) tell us which instruction to execute next
        - stack pointer and frame pointer for parameters
        - local var and ret
    -I/O information

## process API
- Process's API
    - Create: create process. Command in shell, application, the OS will invoke new process to run the program.
    - Destroy: complete by itself or we have the ability to kill it 
    - Wait: wait for a process to stop running
    - Miscellaneous Control: something like suspend and resume later
    - Status: get status for process and how long it was running and checking what state is in.

## Process Creation detail:
- When run program, OS load code into mem (address space)
- program ususally on disk in a executable format
- essentially read from the disk to store in mem
- In early System, loading is **Eagerly**.
- Before loading the program, OS perform processes **lazily** load only needed 
- Before the process is run, OS allocate memory for program's runtime stack
    - sometime also allocate heap (for dynmaics allocated data)
- OS also initalize I/O (Unix's 3 file descriptor)
- Lastly OS runs main() transfer control from cpu to process

## Process states:
- Initial: just created
- final: exit but not clean
- Running: running on processor and executing instruction
- Ready: ready to run but OS didn't instructed to do so
- Blocked: In the blocked state, a process has performed some kind of operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place. A common example: when a process initiates an I/O
request to a disk, it becomes blocked and thus some other process
can use the processor.
- process move from ready to run is called scheduled
- process move from run to ready is called descheduled

## Data Structure:
- OS is like a program, have process list to keep track of all the process
- has something like a register context
- Sometime each info about the process is stored on a PCB (process control block)
