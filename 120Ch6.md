# Mechanism: Limited Direct Ececution
-challenges:
    - how to prevent excessive overhead?
    - how can we have control over cpu with multiple processes?
    - time sharing, cpu goes around different process. How?

## Limited Direct Execution:
- directed execution (ez but come with serveral issue above)
    - run program on CPU
        1. create process
        2. allocate mem
        3. loads the program into mem
        4. Set up stack
        5. clear reg
        6. execute Call
        7. run and return
        8. free mem of process
        9. remove the process from list

## Restricted opertaions
- direct is fast but what if we want to do restricted operation such as I/O or gaining access.
- User mode: can't do anything crazy like issue I/O request
- kernel mode: OS runs in this and can do everything 
- system call: Allow the kernel to expose certain key functionality to the user programs
    - to execute this, program need execute a trap instruction
    - when finished the OS calls return from trap instruction to return to user mode
- Trap table: kernel set up for it to know what code to execute in trap (trap handler)

## Switching between processes
- By defintion, if process is running on CPU then OS is not running???
    - How to regain control of CPU s owe can swtich between processes
- *Cooperative Approach: wait for System Call*
    - OS trust process will behave and periodically give up CPU so OS can decide to run other tasks (sys call)
    - anything that is kind of illegal will transfer control to OS (illegal operation)
- *Non-Cooperative Approach: OS takes control*
    - Timer interrupt, interrupt raised, halt process, handler in OS runs
    - The timer interrupt is set using a timer device, so it is actually the hardware stops the user program
- Saving and Restoring Context
    - Scheduler in OS, decide to run process or switch
    - If decide to switch, we run a context switch
        - Save the reg what is currently running for later resume
    - Timer interrupt occurs, the user register state is saved by hardware using the kernel stack of that process.
    - OS decide to swtich, kernel register state is saved by software into mem of the process.

## Worried about Concurrency?
    - Quicknotes: just do a disable interrupt or other locking scheme
