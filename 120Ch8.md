# Scheduling: The Multi-Level Feedback Queue
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- It tries to resolve two-fold
  - Optimize the turnaround time(running shortest task first)
  - given we dont know the length of the task, how to schedule?

**Rule of MLFQ:**
1. **If A > B in priority, A runs**
2. **If A == B in priority, A&B run RR**
3. **When job enter the system, it's marked as highest priority**
4. **Once a job is up its time in given level, regardless if it give up CPU or not, we reduce the priority**
5. **After time S, Put all the jobs in the system into topMost queue**
  
## MLFQ: Basic Rules
- number of distinct queues, with different priority level
- job ready to run is in the single, determine by the priority will decide which job to run
- same priority, we will use RR (round Robin) scheduling among those jobs 
- MLFQ varies the priority of a job based on the observed behavior.
- basically use te past history of the job to predict the length of the job and changes the priority
- but like if there is so 2 high priority tasks if will never get to the lower priority until those are done...

## Attempt 1: How to change priority (Rule 3 & 4)
- What happened when there is long running job in the system?
  - keep reduce if it doesnt give up CPU cause slice is up
- One long running and one short running?
  - short will join the long one and start running with RR
- I/O? basically if something keep dropping the CPU, it will be kept at the highest priority
- Problems...
  - Starvation: If there are a lot of the interactive job, the long running jobs will never get to run
  - Game the Scheduler: before slice ends issue I/O which tricks the the system to give u same queue
  - behaviors might change

## Attempt 2: Priority boost
- Throw everything in a topmost queue (RULE 5)
- Resolves the problems above
  - no more starving: since priority are the same, RR will serve everything
  - CPU is also a interactivce in some way now
- Problems...
  - S is a voodoo constant which is hard to determine

## Attempt 3: Better accounting
- Better accounting time at each level of the MLFQ to resolve the gaming scheduler
- Basically keep track of the of the time slice each process is using and just demote the process if time's up

## Tuning MLFQ and other issues
- parameterize scheduler is a big issue.
- Most MLFQ variants allow various length for time slices across different queues
- Some MLFQ will use a configuration table to configure its behavior while some will use some mathematical formula to adjust the priorities
