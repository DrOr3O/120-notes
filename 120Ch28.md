# Locks

## Basic idea
```C
lock_tmutex;//someglobally-allocatedlock’mutex’ 
lock(&mutex);
balance=balance+1;
unlock(&mutex);
```
- example of how the lock works for critical section
- lock variable holds the state of lock at any instant in any time (free or held)

## Pthread locks
- POSIX library => mutex (mutual exclusion)
```C
pthread_mutex_tlock=PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
Pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);//wrapper;exitsonfailure 
balance=balance+1;
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```
- passing different to provide more fine grained approach

## evaluating lock
1. provide mutual exclusion
2. fairness, how does threads decide who get the lock next
3. performance

## controlling Interrupts
1. first approach is make lock disable interrupt
    - positive:
        - simple
    - negative:
        - allow any calling threads to do privilege operation
        - doesn't stop multiprocessors
        - interrupts might get lost 
        - inefficient
2. Use Loads/Stores (failed)
    - single flag doesn't work because:
        - correctness
        - Spin-waiting wastes time waiting for another thread to release a lock
3. Test and Set for working spin locks
    - hardware support for the system
    - test and set (atomic exchange) instruction
    ```C
    intTestAndSet(int*old_ptr,intnew){
        intold=*old_ptr;//fetcholdvalueatold_ptr 
        old_ptr=new;//store’new’intoold_ptr 
        returnold;//returntheoldvalue 
    }
    ```
    - test old value and set new value in one single atomic operation
    - type of spin lock, works on CPU cycle
    - preemptive scheduler to work one single processor, change thread on timer
    - not fair, might spin forever
    - perform poor in single cpu but ok in multiple cpu (doesn't waste cycle)
4. Compare and Swap
    - compare and swap instruction (SPARC) or compare and exchange on x86
    - test the value at the address pointed by ptr is equal to expected or not
        -  if it is, set new value to the memory location pointed by pointer
        - if not do nothing
        - either case return the original value
    ```C
    voidlock(lock_t*lock){ 
        while(CompareAndSwap(&lock->flag,0,1)==1)
        ;//spin 
    }
    ```
    - we can change the test and set to this 
    - for now just know the behaviors are similiar to the spin lock above
5. Load-Linked and Store-Conditional
    - load linked is the same and simply fetches a value from mem and place it in reg
    - store-conditional only go through if no intervene store to the address has taken place
    - if success, if update the ptr value and return 1, failed will not update ptr and return 0

6. Fetch and Add
    - atomically increment the value when returning the old value at particular address
    - when thread want to acquire the lock, it does fetch and add
    - then global var turn will be used to determine whose turn is it 
    - the ticket value ensure all threads will get a turn

## Prevent long spin?
    1. Just yield?
        - when you are going to spin, just give up the cpu to another thread
        - yield essentially is a deschedule
        - still pretty ass
    2. How about a queue with sleep instead of yield
        - previous attempts leave too much choices to the scheduler
        - use park() to put any threads that try to access lock before it is free
        - didnt dodge the spin time completely since we are still using spin lock (guard) around the main lock
        - wakeup/waiting race is prevented by the setpark()
