# Paging: Faster Translation (TLBs)
- paging usually requires going into physical mem for lookup for each virtual address (slow)
- adding Translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to increase translate speed
- TLB is part of the MMU (memory management unit)
- hardware cache of the virtual to physical address translation 

## TLB basic algorithm
```C
VPN = (VirtualAddress & VPN_MASK) >> SHIFT
(Success, TlbEntry) = TLB_Lookup(VPN)
if (Success == True) // TLB Hit
    if (CanAccess(TlbEntry.ProtectBits) == True)
    Offset = VirtualAddress & OFFSET_MASK
    PhysAddr = (TlbEntry.PFN << SHIFT) | Offset
    Register = AccessMemory(PhysAddr)
    else
        RaiseException(PROTECTION_FAULT)
else // TLB Miss
    PTEAddr = PTBR + (VPN * sizeof(PTE))
    PTE = AccessMemory(PTEAddr)
    if (PTE.Valid == False)
        RaiseException(SEGMENTATION_FAULT)
    else if (CanAccess(PTE.ProtectBits) == False)
        RaiseException(PROTECTION_FAULT)
    else
        TLB_Insert(VPN, PTE.PFN, PTE.ProtectBits)
        RetryInstruction()
```
- assume linear page table and hardware based TLB
- get VPN from virtual address and see if TLB has the translation of it
    - If it does, TLB hit
        - extract PFN concatenate to offset
        - from physical address and access memory
    - If it doesn't, TLB miss
        - access the page table to find translation
        - update TLB with translation (costly)
        - hardware recheck the instruction 

## Better perfromance?
- example: 10 4 bytes int in mem, virtual address starts 100, 8-bit virtual address space with 16 bytes page 
2^4 = 16, 4 bit VPN and 4 offset
- first access of the different will be a miss but other one will be hit.
- if we have loop this, it will get even better perfromance becuse of temoral locality  
- Caching is taking advantage of locality of intruction and tempoal/spatial locality 

## Handle TLB miss
- Hardware (CISC instructions)
    - need to know the table base register location in mem and the format
    - on miss-> walk -> correct-> translate ->update TLB -> retry instruction
    - some old school stuff
- Software (RISC instrucitons)
    - pause current instruction stream -> raise privilege -> jump to trap handler
    - trap handler: look up translation in page table -> update TLB -> return from trap (then hardware can retry)
    - **When return from the trap, OS will continue to execute the instruction caused the trap** (unlike syscall which do instruction after the trap)
    - simple and flexible

- Need to worry not to cause chain TLB miss
    - we can put TLB miss handler in physical mem
    - reserve entries for permanently address translation 
    - These always hit (wired)

## TLB valid != page talbe valid
- PTE is invalid means that page has not been allocated by the process and shouldn't be access
    - Usually kill the process if we try to access
- TLB is valid means that there's a valid translation 

## TLB contents:
VPN|PFN|other bits
- if translation can be in either PFN or VPN, is called fully associative 
- other bits include the valid, protection, dirty, AS identifier and others

## Context Switches:
- TLB only for 1 process 
- 1st approach: Flush the TLB on context switches
    - empty it before running next process (software: just a privileged instruction, hardware: when page base register is changed)
    - set everything to 0
    - **not great if context swtiches happen often**
- 2nd appraoch: hardware provided: Address space identifier (ASID)
    - can hold different process TLB by different identifier 
    - **2 virtual address can share same physical page**

## Replacement policy:
- when installing new entry on TLB, we need to replace one, but which one?
- common approach: LRU entry (least recently used)
- common approach: Random
