# Locality and The Fast Swap File System
- old file system = Super block | Inodes    | Data        |
- poor performance

## Problem of poor performance
- It was treating the disk as a RAM
- expensive seek from the data to inode
- system itself can get very fragmented

## FFS: Disk Awareness is the Solution
- Fast File System, Same interface different implementation
  
## organize Structure: The Cylinder Group
- divide disk to the numbers of cylinder groups
- single cylinder is set of tracks on different surfaces of the hard disk that's same distance to the center.
- modern file system organize files into block groups with 8 blocks in 1 group
- Contents of a group
  - super block: for mounting system
  - inode bitmap: tracking if inode is allocated 
  - data bitmap: tracking if the data is allocated
  - inode & data: same ol same ol

## Policies: how to allocate files and Directories
- keep related stuff together and not related stuff apart
  - The first is the placement of directories
    - low number of directories and high number of free inodes, and put directory data and inode in that group
  - For Files:
    - make sure to allocate teh data blocks of files in the same group as the inodes, prevent long seek
    - place all files under same directory in the cylinder group they are in 
      - ex: /a/b, /a/c,/a/d,andb/f   first 3 together, last one far

## Measuring File locality
- SEER trace

## Large File Exception
- we dont want large file to stop related file to be in
- after a series of chunk we will seperate it up to different group
- amortization reduce the overhead through doing more work
- The chunk size is determined by the inode size 
- transfer data between seek is how we amortize the costs 

## of thing about FFS
- sub block until we get the actual block size
  - slow and expensive, usually get buffered until the entire block is there
- Second question is sequential reading, where read block 0 and then block 1 but is too late
  - solved through parameterization, read every other block
  - However this only give us 50% of the bandwidth
  - Modern solution: read entire track and buffer in internal cache
