# Paging: smaller tables
- problem of page table consume too much space
- ex: 32 bit address, 4KB pages, 4 byte entry => 2^32/2^12 => * 4 = 4MB page table size
## Simple solution: Bigger page?
- assume we have 16KB pages => 2^32/ 2^16 => 2^18 entries and sicne we have 18VPN, 1MB per page table 
- Problem is that we will have worse internal fragmentation

## Hybrid: Paging and Segments?
- 3 different page table, 1 for each segment (code, heap, stack)
- use base and bound to save all 3 tables
- huge mem saving due to the bound
- unallocated space between heap and stack no longer take space since they will be marked as invalid
- not flexible due to expectation of how to use the address space
- finding space is complicated
- external fragmentation again

## Multi-level page table:
- chop page table into page-sized unit
- if the entire page of that page table is invalid, dont allocate at all
  - (new structure called page directory to track validity)
  - tells where page is and valid and contain valid page or not
- page directory contains:
  - page directory entires (PDE) (if this is valid means that 1 page of the page table is valid)
  - valid bit
  - page frame number
- save a lot of space
- easier to manage mem because portion of the page table fit into 1 page
- **Worse if TLB miss, we need 2 loads, 1 for page directory and another for PTE**
- more complex
  
## EXAMPLE:
16KB address sapce space, 64bytes pages
    - 14 bit virtual address space (2^14)
    - offset of 6 (2^6) then VPN of 8
    - linear would have 2^8 = 256 entries
- Virtual page 0 and 1 is for code, 4 and 5 for heap, 254 and 255 for stack.

- To build the 2 level page table, we break it up to page size, 256 entire assume each entry is 4 bytes = 1KB (256 * 4) table size
- since our pages are 64 bytes we have 16 64 bytes pages each page holds 16 PTE
- 16 PE entries since we have 16 pages in page table so we use top 4 bits of the VPN
- now we have PDindex, PDE can be aquired through = pageDirBase + (PDindex * size of (PDE))
- if PDE is valid we will need to fetch PTE from the page table pointed by the PDE 
- we will need the remaining VPN as page table index 
- Address PTE = (PDE.PFN << SHIFT) + (PTidnex * Size of (PTE))


## Inverted page table
- single page, with each physical page of the system
## Swapping page table to the disk
- put page table into kernel vritual mem
- allow swapping to the disk
