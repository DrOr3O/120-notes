# Concurrency
- Multithread, think each thread is like process but they share the same adress space thus can access the same data
- single thread is like single process, has a PC where program is fetching instruction from
- swtiching thread in single processor is like switching process, context switch is required
- we need TCB(Thread control blocks)
- multiple threads will exist multiple stacks, thus multi-threaded process will have address space looking different
- y stack-allocated variables, parameters, return values, and other things that we put on the stack will be placed in
what is sometimes called thread-local storage, i.e., the stack of the relevant thread.

## why thread?
- parallelism, doing multiple works at once in multiple CPU
- while one thread in your program waits (i.e., is blocked waiting for I/O), the CPU scheduler can switch to other threads
- Threading enable overlap of I/O in a *single* program, just like multiprocessing did *across* multiple program

### Notes on how to use threads and processes effectively
Of course, in either of the cases mentioned above, you could use multiple processes instead of threads. However, threads share an address space
and thus make it easy to share data, and hence are a natural choice when
constructing these types of programs. Processes are a more sound choice
for logically separate tasks where little sharing of data structures in memory is needed.

## Thread Creation
- OS sceduler will determine how the threads execute and return depends on the programs

## Shared data and uncontrolled scheduling
- OS interrupt might happen during some key functionality 
- race condition might happen ex: increment is not execute correct because threads are fighting each other.
- **critical section** is a piece of code that accesses a shared variable (or more generally, a shared resource)
and must not be concurrently executed by more than one thread
- We want **mutual exclusion** to be used on critical section to ensure when 1 thread is running then other can't concurrently run it.

## Atomicity (all or nothing)
- hardware gurantee us the instructions are completed or not at all
- synchronization of primitives, access the critical section in a synchronized time

## Waiting for others in another problem
- That's another chapter though :P
