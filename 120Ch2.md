## Ch1 small stuff
- Three thing OS is doing: Virtualization, Concurrency, and persistence.

## Ch2 
- Fetch decode execute
- The OS takes a physical resource (processor, memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a virtual form of itself. Thus, we sometimes refer to the operating system as a virtual machine
- OS also known as resource manager
- every fetch is access the mem

### Virtualization of CPU:
- taking physical resources (processor, mem, disk) into virtual
- OS provides serveral system call (API call) to run programs and other interaction which is also know as STD
- we interact with OS though API and kinda like turning cpu into mini cpu.
- Policy of the OS determine which program to run when there is multiple of the executing.
### Virtualization of mem:
- To read mem, we need the address to write or update.
- Each process has its own virtual address space but the physical is actually shared

### Concurrency:
- problem might happen because the insturctions is not executed all at once 

### Persistence:
- DRAM: volatile store, data inside is lost when power is gone or crashed
- Thus I/O is needed for storing persistently
    - hard drive & SSD
    - file system store data on disks of the system
- Unlike CPU and memory, the OS doesn't create a private and virtualized disk for each application.
- It assumes users will want to share information on the disk
- Journaling and copy-on-write is there for recovery

### Goals for design:
- minimize overheads and provide high performance.
- protection through isolating processes.
- energy-efficient, reliable, and mobile.

### History class?
- Early OS
    - just libraries
    - process batch
- Then protection:
    - file system as libraries
    - system call: transfer control (jump) while raising the hardware privilege level
    - user application run in user mode
    - sys call will switch to kernel mode
- Era of multiprogramming
    - problems of concurrency comes up
    - mem protection from each program
