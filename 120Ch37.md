# Hard Disk Drives

## The interface
- large sector like arrays
- only guarantee is single 512 bytes write atomically 
- accessing continously is faster than randomly access

## Basic Geometry
- platter = circualr hard surface where data is stored by inducint magnetic changes
  - 2 side, called surface
- spindle = bound the platter, connected to the motor that spins the platter
  - spins like 7200 to 15000 rpm
- Track = concentric circle of sectors of surface that stores data
- disk head = reading and writing through magnetic patterns, one per surface of the drive
- disk arm = moves the disk head

## Simple disk drive
- Single track latency:
  - 1 track, wanna read block 0
  - rotate disk till block is under the disk head which cause rotational delay
- Multiple Track seek time:
  - modern disk has millions track
  - to move from a sector to another, the arm will seek the sector
  - **seek along with rotation is most costly**
  - seek has phases = acceleration, coasting, decceleration, and settling (cost a bit)
  - finally the transfer from surface
- Other detail:
  - track skew is used to make sure sequential read can be properly serviced when cross track boundaries
  - Which is designed so we dont need to wait for a full rotation
  - Multi-zoned disk drive is also a thing, numbered, and has more space outer zone than inner zone
  - Cache/track buffer = small amount of mem use to hold data for operations 
  - write back caching: acknowledge write has completed when is put in mem (fast but dangerous)
  - write through caching: acknowledge write has completed when is put in disk

## I/O time: doing the math
- Time of I/O = time of seek + rotation + transfer
- Rate of I/O = size of transfer / time I/O

## Disk Scheduling:
- SJF usually (shortest job first)
- SSTF (shortest seek time first)
  - orders the queue of I/O request by track and pick only ther nearest one 
  - NBF (nearest block first)
  - request with nearest address first
- What about starvation"?
- Elevator (SCAN or C-SCAN)
  - scan back and forth across the disk to service request in order across the tracks
  - single pass across the disk is called sweep
  - basically if a request is from block on track that already been serviced on this sweep, dont handle immediately
  - F-SCAN: freeze the queue when scanning
  - C-SCAN: sweep from outer to inner (circular)
  - However this ignore rotation thus is not as good as SSTF
- SPTF (Shortest positioning time first)
- basically seek time but consider the rotation
- We also got something like I/O merging (close or connected sector first)
- wait or not wait request :/
