# Thread API

## Thread creation

```C
#include <pthread.h>
int
pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,
const pthread_attr_t *attr,
void *(*start_routine)(void*),
void *arg);
```
- sample declaration of the thread creating function, take  4 arguments 
- first argument "thread" is pointer to structure type that will be used to interact with the thread
- second argument "attr" specify any attributes thread might have (most cases NULL is ok)
- third arugment basically means which function should this thread run, is a function pointer with function name and type
- foruth arugment is just the arg for the function the thread will be running 

## Thread Completion
- what if we want to wait for thread to be complete?
```C
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
```
- first argument indicate what we are waiting, second is a return pointer we expected 
- second argument is a pointer to the value because pthread_join change the value itself 
- sometime we dont can about these things and can just use NULL
- never return a pointer which refers to something allocated on the threadâ€™s call stack.

## Locks
- used to lock your critical section codes
```C
pthread_mutex_t lock;
pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
x = x + 1; // or whatever your critical section is
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```
- if no other threads hold the lock when first line is called, thread will get the lock and enter critical section
- thread can get stucked waiting for lock when others have the lock though
```C
int rc = pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
assert(rc == 0); // always check success!
```
- example for creating the lock, first arg is the lock address second arg is extra attribute
- when going into lock we should check error code for lock and unlock
- pthread mutex destroy() should be used to destroy the lock when everthing is done 

## Condition Variables
- useful for signaling between threads
```C
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
```
- should have lock when use condtion variables 
- The first routine, pthread cond wait(), puts the calling thread to
sleep, and thus waits for some other thread to signal it, usually when
something in the program has changed that the now-sleeping thread might
care about.
-each threads has its own stack
- **DONE USE SIMPLE FLAG TO SIGNAL BETWEEEN THREADS**
