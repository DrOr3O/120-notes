# Beyond Physical mem: mechanism
- Since is slow , with large address space we just need to allocate the mem needed
- old way: mem overlay, swapping code in and out mem as needed

## Swap space
- reserve space on disk for moving pages around
- OS will need to remember the disk address of the page
- size determine the amount of page we can move into
  
## The Present Bit
- On mem reference, extract VPN from virtual address and check TLB then if hit translate a physical address and fetch it to mem
  - if TLB miss, we look at page table in mem (through the base register) and look up PTE using VPN as index
- If we want page to be swapped to the disk, we need some machinery
- Present bit is used to show if the page is in the physical mem, if not is usually a page fault

## Page Fault
- In either system, when page is not present OS will handle things 
- Does OS know where the page is? (Answer is in the bits of PTE), then issue request to disk to fetch the page to mem
- When disk I/O completes, OS will udpate the page table as present and update PFN of table entry and retry instruction
- It might generate a TLB miss but then the rest is old news
- **This will result the process being blocked**

## What if the mem is full
- page replacement policy....

## Page Fault Control FLow:
- 3 important cases when TLB miss
  - page is present and valid:
    - TLB miss handler grab PFN from the PTE and retry
  - !Present but valid
    - page fault handler run 
  - !valid
    - OS trap handler
## When replacement actually happen
- Most system has Hight Watermark or Low Watermark to help decide when to swtich out pages
  - When OS realized there are fewer than LW pages around it will start evict page until there are HW pages avaliable
    - helped by swap/page daemon
- Some system will cluster pages to make it easier
