# Scheduling: Introduction

## Workload Assumptions
- workload: process running in the system
- Assumption we made for the process/job
  - Each job run the same amount of time
  - All job arrive at the same time
  - Once started, each job must runs to completion
  - All jobs only use the CPU
  - runtime of each job is known 

## Scheduling metrics
- Turnaround Time = Time that job complete - Time that job arrived to the system

## FIFO
- First in First out
- There could be a problem of convoy effect where the Longer job blocked the shorter jobs

## Shortest job first
- Fairly optimal but our assumption made it too good.
- What if the huge task arrive before the smaller job?
- Then same thing will happened as the FIFO problem.

## Shortest TIme-Completion First (STCF) / Preemptive Shortest Job First
- Realistically, job don't have to run to completion
- anytime a job get into the system, the scheduler determine how long does it take to finish the job then schedule the least amount to finish one.

## Response Time
- Response Time = Time of first run - Time of Arrival

## Round Robin/Time Slicing
- Instead of running job to complete, we run a job or time slice (scheduling quantum) then we switch to the next job.
- Time slice the multiple of timer-interrupt period
- Example:
  - Assuming job A, B, C arrive at the same time.
  - each wish to run for 5 sec
  - RR with time splice of 1 will be response time of (0+1+2)/3 = 1 compared to (0 + 5 + 10)/3 = 5.
- Long slice will make the runtime even worse if we use turnaround time

- **SJF and STCF optimizes turnaround time but bad for response time.**
- **RR optimizes response time but bad for turnaround**

## Incorporating I/O
- So the fact is that every programs perform I/O
- scheduler has a decision to make when job iniate I/O request
  - currently job wont use CPU while I/O, it is blocked waiting for I/O to be done
  - Thus schedule should schedule something else 
- Another decision make when I/O complete => interrupt, blocked to Ready state
- By treating each CPU burst as a job, scheduler plans both small I/O request and huge task to allow overlapping and interactive

## No more Oracle
- But how does Scheduler know  the length of each job
