# Process API
- process creation in unix with fork() exec() and wait()

## The fork() system call
- used to create new process.
- When executed, there will be a PID
- after running, it will seems there are 2 copies of the caller process and both are about to return from fork()
- The child process doesn't run main(), it just kinda there
- The child process fork returns 0 and after it creates as book example, the result of the process run is non-deterministic 

## The Wait() system call
- basically just wait till other process is done. 

## exec() system call
- useful when want to run a program that's not caller program
- give the name of executable and arguments, loads the code and executable then OVERWRITE current code segment.
- basically use the same processes and run the new program. Heap and Stack are reintialized.

### How shell works under the table
The shell is just a user program. It shows you a prompt and then
waits for you to type something into it. You then type a command (i.e.,
the name of an executable program, plus any arguments) into it; in most
cases, the shell then figures out where in the file system the executable
resides, calls fork() to create a new child process to run the command,
calls some variant of exec() to run the command, and then waits for the
command to complete by calling wait(). When the child completes, the
shell returns from wait() and prints out a prompt again, ready for your
next command.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int rc = fork();
    if (rc < 0) {
        // fork failed
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    } else if (rc == 0) {
        // child: redirect standard output to a file
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        open("./p4.output", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC, S_IRWXU);

        // now exec "wc"...
        char *myargs[3];
        myargs[0] = strdup("wc"); // program: wc (word count)
        myargs[1] = strdup("p4.c"); // arg: file to count
        myargs[2] = NULL; // mark end of array
        execvp(myargs[0], myargs); // runs word count
    } else {
        // parent goes down this path (main)
        int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
example of how process create new child and run exec in that child. The result has been redirect to the p4.output

## Process control and User
- Kill() send a signal to process like pause die and other stuff.
- signal() can be used to call processes group
