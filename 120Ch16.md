# Segmentation
- putting entire address mem is wasting space (internal fragmentation)

## Generalized base/bound
- having base and bound per logical segment of the address space
- need heap, code, stack's base and bound registers

## What segment are we refer to?
- explicit approach:
    - chop up address to segment based on the top few bits of the virtual address
    - first couple bits for indicating what part is it, the rest are offset 
    - using top bits are very limited size
- implicit approach:
    - determine by hardware through how the address is formed

## How about Stacks?
- we need 1 bit to show where does the stack grows, 1 for positive, 0 for negative
- offset minus segment => correct signed offset
## support for Sharing
- code sharing or sharing mem
- hardware support protection bits
- rwx shit 

## Fine grained vs Coarse grained
- segmentation table

## OS support
- compacted and non-compacted mem (stashed up or not)
- problem 1: context switch -> save and restore
- problem 2: segment grows/shrink->
    - heap request the space
    - find free space or updating seg size register to grow
    - or reject if some issues
- problem 3: free space in physical mem (little holes of free space) -> compaction (expensive)
    - or use some other helpers to determine best fitting place
