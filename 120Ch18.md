# Intro Paging
- OS size issue
    - chop to varied size, like segmentation (can be fragmented)
    - chop to fixed size, like the paging, more flexible 
- we view physical mem as a fixed size array called page frames

## Simple example and Overview
- 64 bytes, 4 16 bytes page
- page table: record where the virtual address space is placed in physical memory (per process)
    - mainly use for store address translation
    - per process
movl <virtual address>, %eax
- to translate this we need 2 component, VPN and offset
- 64 bytes = 2^6 thus we need 6 bits total to our address
- since the page is 16 bytes, first 0 ~ 3 bit is offset (2^4 = 16)
-  example: movl 21, %eax
    - 21 = 010101
    - 01 0101, this means the address is 5th byte (0101) of the 1st page (01)
    - since virtual 1 is physical 7 in this case, we translate this to 1110101 (keep the offset)

## What's in the page table
- PTE (page table entry)
    - valid bit: translation valid or not 
    - protection bit: indicate whether the page can be access, write or execute
    - present bit: on disk or in memory (swapping allow OS to free physical mem)
    - dirty bit: indicate whether it has been modified since in the mem
    - reference bit: check what page is accessed or critical 
- linear page table (array)
    - index array by the VPN, looks up PTE to find PFN (page frame number, physical page number)

## Paging can be slow still
- hardware will need to know where the page table is for the current running process
- page table base register contains physical address of the starting location of the page table 
- basically each memory access requires the extra memory reference
