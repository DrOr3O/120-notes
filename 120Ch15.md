# Mechanism: Address translation
- Recall Limited Direct Execution: mainly rely on hardware unless needed for OS to involve through interposing
## Virtualizing the Memory
- Hardware based address translation
- changing the virtual address provided by the instruction to physical address
    - ### Assumption
    - assume size is not too big, address space must be contiguously placed in physical mem
    - less than size of physical mem
    - each address is the same size 

    - ### Interpostion
    - Virtualizing mem, the hardware interpose on each mem access, translate virtual address provided by the process to physical

## Example:
- program that use 16KB mem, address will seems to some numbers, to it's own perspective will be address 0
- in order to virtualize mem, we basically need to relocate them to another physical mem

## Dynamic Relocation:
- Thus we need this address translation
- Use base register of the CPU and limit register of the CPU (Base and Bound)
- Hardware will do this to get physical address
    - Physical address = virtualized address (made by process) + base
    - Use bound register to check if the move is legal

## What do we need from hardware?
- Kernel mode
- single bit process status word to indicate what mode CPU is on
- base and bound registers 
- (Memory management Unit)
- special instructions to modify base and bound registers
- exception handling for registers and raise exception


## OS involvement
- When process created, OS need to find space for its address space in mem
- OS also needs to track the part of the mem that's free (A free list)
- Handling exception
- When Process terminates, OS need to reclaim the space back to free list
- When context switches, save and restores base and bound registers in process structure or PCB
- If process is stopped, OS can move the address location:
    - deschedule process, copy address space from current location to new location, update based register to point new location
