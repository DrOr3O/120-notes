# Condition Variables
- Using a variable shared between the functions are inefficient
- A condition variable is an explicit queue that threads can put themselves on when some state of execution
(i.e., some condition) is not as desired (by waiting on the condition);
- some other thread, when it changes said state, can then wake one (or more) of those waiting threads and thus allow them to continue
- 2 operation
    - wait(): thread put itself to sleep
    - signal(): signaling the waiting thread that certain condition is met (changed)
- to prevent race condition:
    - it assumes that this mutex is locked when wait() is called. The responsibility of wait() is to release the lock and put the
    calling thread to sleep (atomically);
    - when thread wake up need to re-acquire the lock
- Hold the lock when calling signal or wait


## Producer/Consumer problem
- producer puts item on the buffer
    - only put in when when buffer is empty
- consumer takes away item on the buffer
    - only take when buffer is full

- Reasons that we use while loop for waiting and not if
    - woken threads immediately recheck the value
- producer threads wait on the condition empty, and signals fill. Conversely, consumer threads wait on fill and signal empty
- We can also use covering condition by just wake every thread up.
