# Files and Directories
- Each process has an array of the open file table, system wide
- each entry on the table tracks which underlying file the descriptor refer to, offset and other details 
## Files and Directories
- File
  - simple linear array of bytes
  - each file has some low level name (refer as inode number)
- Directory
  - also has low level name
  - contains list of (user readble name, low level name)
- Directory Tree
  - starts at the root directory
  - use seperator to name sub-sequent directories
  - Directories and files can have same names as long as they are in different location in the file system tree.

## The File System Interface
- **Creating Files**
  - open() syscall
    ```C
    int fd = open("foo",O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR);
    ```
    - Second parameter create the file if it doesnt exist, ensure the file can only be written to ,truncates the already exist file to a size of zero bytes thus remove any contents
    - Third parameter specify the permission of the files (R&W by owner in this case)
  - note that open() return a file descriptor, an int used to access files
  - Each process already have 3 files open, stdin, stdout, stderr
- **Reading and Writing Files**
  - read()
    - arugment is a file descriptor, second argument is buffer of where to read to
  - Write()
    - similiar arguments set up
  - lseek() to look up offset?
    ```C
    off_t lseek(int fildes,off_t offset,int whence);
    ```
    - arguments: file descriptor, offset position in the file, and how the seek is performed
    - When process open files, there is current offset
    - can be update in 2 ways
      - current offset + N bytes of either read or write
      - lseek to set the offset according to the whence (SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END)
- **Shared File Table Entries, FORK and DUP**
  - If different process access the same file at the same time, they will have their own entry on the open file table
  - However, some cases the files will be shared
    - Fork() 
      ```C
      int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
        assert(fd >= 0);
        int rc = fork();
        if (rc == 0) {
          rc = lseek(fd, 10, SEEK_SET);
          printf("child: offset %d\n", rc);
        } else if (rc > 0) {
          (void) wait(NULL);
          printf("parent: offset %d\n",
          (int) lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR));
        }
        return 0;
      } 
      ```
      - When file table is shared, we will increment the reference count
      - only when both process exit or close the file will the entry be removed
    - Dup()
      - allow process to create a new file descriptor refer to the same open file as the existed file descriptor
- **Writting immediately with fsync()**
  - most time with write is writing to the presistent storage, the file system will buffer
  - When process call fsync, the file system respond by forcing all dirty data into the disk for file pointed by the descriptor 
  - Notice that is best to fsync the directory where the file is as well

## Renaming Files
- atomic syscall rename()
- When we are updating the file, the file editor will ensure update this way:
  - open a temp file, fsync it to disk, when application is certain new file is on the disk, rename temp to the original name

## Getting info about files
- Metadata => info about the files
- stat() or fstat() for checking metadata
  - takes path or file descriptor as argument
  - data includes: size, low level name, ownership info, when the file was modified or accessed
  - These info are stored in inode
  - All inode are in disk, active ones are cached

## Removing files
- unlink() huh?

## Making Directories
- we can't write to directory directly because directory is considered as metadata of the file system
- only can update indirectly
- mkdir()
  - consider empty contents beside 2 entries
    - one entry of itself => .
    - one entry of parent => ..
## Reading Directories
- readdir() ok....

## deleting directories
- rmdir(), requires the directory being empty

## Hard Links
- so that unlink()?
- link() is a way of making entry in file system
  - take old pathname and new one as arguments
  - when we link we essentially make a new refer to the same file 
  - it simply create another name in the directory we are link to, and refer it to the same inode as the original file.
  - Not really copy but more like 2 readable name but refer to the same file 
  - so no difference between the og file and the one you linked to
- so WHY UNLINK()
  - When we are creating files, it really is 2 things
    - we make a structure, the inode, that track all info about the file
    - we put a readable name to the file,and put that link into the directory
  - When we unlink, the file system will check the reference count within the inode number
  - the link between the inode break system will decrement the reference count, only when it reaches zero the file is truly deleted

## Symbolic Links/Soft Links
- Hard Link's downside => can't create one to the directory, can't link to file in another disk partition
- symbolic link is file itself in a different type 
- form by holding the pathname to the linked file as the data of the link file 
- removing the soft link will cause dangling reference which fucked up the linked file

## Permission bits and the Access Control bits
- Unix permission bits -rw-r--r--
  - 3 grouping, owner, group, and others
  - RWX you know it
- ACL 
  - per directories

## Making and mounting a file system
- mkfs
  - just write the empty file system
- The mount program make it accessible within the uniform file-system tree.
  - takes existing directory as target mount point nad paste the new file system onto the directory tree
