# File System Implementation
- Very simple File System
- purely software

## Think
- Data Structure
  - arrays are the simplest
- Access Method
  - how do we open, read, write

## Overall organization
- Divide the disk to block size (e.g. 4KB)
- assume we ahve 64 blocks
- **data region**= place for user data
- **metadata** = track the file, size, owner and other info
  - Store in inode
- **Inode table** = holds array of on-disk inodes
- **Allocation Structure** = holds whether inode or data block is allocated or not
  - Free list or something else (here is a bitmap)
  - **Bitmap**
    - one for data region one for inode table
- **Super block** = contains info about the file system

## File organiztation: The table
- inode = index node
- refer by a number/low level name (i number)
- ex: given i number, calculate where inode is
  - table of 20KB (5 * 4 KB)
  - 80 inodes, assuming each of them is 156 bytes assuming the inode starts at 12 KB
  - (superblock is at  0kb, inode bitmap address = 4KB and the bitmap is 8KB)
  - to read inode 32, we will need to calculate offset first 32Â·sizeof(inode)or8192 then added to the start 
  - which is 20 KB.
  - since disk is not byte addressable = 20 * 1024/512
  - sector address = blk=(inumber*sizeof(inode_t))/blockSize;
  - => sector=((blk*blockSize)+inodeStartAddr)/sectorSize;
- How does it refer to the data?
  - use direct pointer that just point to the disk part of the file 
- *MultI level INDEX*
  - indrect pointer
  - point to the block that holds more pointer

## Directory  Organization
- remember deleting file will cause an empty space in middle of the directory
- file system treat directory as a special file and it has its own inode
- has datablock pointed by the inode, the data block lived inside the data region

## Free Space management
- 2 bitmap used
- When the file is created, we allocate the inode, file system will go through the inode that's free, allocate and mark it used and update the bit map. 
- Some system use pre-allocation through finding sequence of the free blocks

## Access Paths: R & W
- Reading a File From Disk
  - example: open /foo/bar read then close
` - assume file is 3 blocks 
  - Traves the pathname
    - first the inode of root
    - look through the data of the root which are directories
    - traverse to find the inode of the foo
    - read the block of the inode foo and the data
    - finally getting to the inode of the bar
      - Then open! read bar's inode into mem, allocate FD then return to user
    - once open, we can read then be done and deallocate`
- Writing a file to Disk
  - Writing files is similar to the reading the file
  - it might need to allocate the block unless the block is being overwritten
  - need to consider writing to disk and which block to allocate and update
  - each write to the file generates 5 I/O
    - read the data bitmap (make the new allocated block)
    - write the bitmap
    - read inode
    - write inode
    - write to actual block
- Create the file
  - allcoate node and directory
    - read inode bitmap
    - write inode bitmap
    - write the inode itself
    - to the data of directory
    - read directory inode
    - write directory inode
    - If the directory need more space, we need to allocate more I/O

## Caching and Buffering
- Cache with DRAM
- At the beginning with use static partitioning with fixed size cache and LRU
  - could still be wasteful what if we have abundance of resource
- dynamic paritioning
  - combine virtual mem page and file system pages into unified page cache
- What about write? caching doesnt work
  - write buffering
  - batch updates into smaller I/Os
- Direct I/O or raw disk interface can also be used for system that doesn't appreciate the loss of data
